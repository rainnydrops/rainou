# About this website

This is a place where I share my footprints, my notes, my projects, and maybe even some of my thoughts as I go along my journey. The website link is only shared with those who may need my knowledge or want to know a little more about me.

I hope that some digital trace of me will be left behind for my future self to look back on. At the same time, I also hope my friends and coworkers can reference this website when they need my knowledge in a pinch. These are all the notes that I've taken down on my digital notebook, I'll only share the notes that may benefit others. Some notes may be tailored specifically to me, so read them with a grain of salt.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message. The website is still under development. I hope one day this site will come to represent me in the long history of the digital age. Or perhaps, further in the future, whoever reads this will have become an eternal digital consciousness... which might be another form of AI?

I wonder if this behavior of posting on a website could be considered another form of digital eternal consciousness, since I expect it to sit there forever.. Anyway, my profile is posted on the homepage, and my music is on SoundCloud. DO tell me if you like my music, it will encourage me to keep creating them in my free time. I will keep updating my notes whenever I have time :)
